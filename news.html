          	<p>Greetings one and all. Continue reading if you are interested in hearing the latest updates about the new book coming soon, Concordia. <br>
		Writing is finished! I am currently in the editing stages, going through the manuscript over and over again. I am really proud of it and excited for everyone to learn a bit more about the universe that is Shamerra because you have not seen anything yet. Enjoy the synopsis below:
	<br>
		For fans of Brian Jacques Redwall series and David Peterson’s Mouseguard, and readers captivated by the fast paced action and high concept world building of Robin Hobb’s Farseer series.
 <br><hr><br>
Thaddeus, a young tikpo leaves his abusive home and is taken in by a gader named Story. During that time Story works as a florist for the royal family of Solitary and Thaddeus her helper. When Thaddeus and his friend witness a murder, he is beaten and left for dead. Determined to find the culprits and bring them to justice, Story tells Thaddeus of her mysterious past. She once trained in the magic sword art used by Kingsman, now since vanished. Thaddeus becomes steadfast to never again be the victim and begins his training to resurrect the Kingsman and master the sword art that is known as, Concordia.
It is during that time that the kingdom begins to descend into chaos and Thaddeus at the center of it. The royal family begins to be mysteriously murdered and the King goes to great lengths to bring Solitary a powerful Kingsman once again to solve this mystery. Thaddeus sets out to prove his skill as a Kingsman and bring and end to the chaos.
Follow Thaddeus as he grows stronger, follow Story as you dive into her past, and follow the Kingdom of Solitary as it struggles to maintain order. This is, Tales of Tikpo: Concordia.
	<br><hr><br> 
This is the first of a projected duology and an installment of a previously published novel - Keepers of Grimoire: Rise of the Keepers.

			<p class="bio">Aspiring Novelist, Brian Shukwit: Imagination has always been one of my greatest tools. Escaping to far away worlds in an instant with just a thought. Creating places, friends, dangers, adventure and excitement all in the comfort of my own mind. The stories would build up so I just HAD to get them out – so I began writing them down. At an early age, they were not some genius material or prodigy writing but it was fun for me. So I kept doing it and doing it. Now in my 30’s I have had enough people tell me to put myself out there, so here I am. I write because I enjoy it. I write because the worlds I create need to escape. I don’t write for money or fame, I write so people can have a piece of my imagination to take with them. I hope you enjoy my works and I look forward to hearing your thoughts. Stay tuned for more imagination! </p>
