	Dear Hiring Manager,

Thank you for the opportunity to contact your company. I am looking to grow. In my current position I am at a stalemate, there is no place for me to continue forward in the career that I want to do. I want to be a Developer/Programmer and start working as a Junior Developer/Programmer so I can learn by doing. I work well with others and I need someone who is willing to take me and mold me into a great Developer/Programmer. Currently, during this time I am looking for remote work.</p>
<p>
I am a hard-working recent college graduate (BS in Web Development) from Liberty University. During the course of my academic career I managed to accrue nearly 7 years of work experience. I had the privilege of working for GHG Corporation and working on their Time and Attendance software in a SQL Developer role. My current position has me where I spend my days with the SQL query language and Microsoft SQL Server, among other software. My time is split in many directions, some I write complex queries to generate reports or create new data. Other times it is creating functions to perform customizations that have been requested by customers. And other times it is creating and maintaining databases. In my free time I am learning more about programming languages like Python, Java and Javascript.</p>
<p>
I have been consistently praised as a diligent worker by my supervisors and peers. Whether working on academic, extracurricular, or professional projects I apply proven technical, writing, and problem-solving skills which I hope to one day leverage for you.

After reviewing my resume, I hope you will consider me for any future positions should they open up.

Thank you for your consideration and for your valuable time. I look forward to hearing from you in the future.</p>

Regards,
Brian Shukwit.
