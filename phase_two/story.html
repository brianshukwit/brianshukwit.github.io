If you are here then I assume that means you are interested in my story and by story I mean what brought me here today career-wise. It hopefully won’t be boring and I appreciate you being here, so let’s begin.

	I have been working since I was 15 years old. I started my freshman year of high school, no summer break for me. I worked each summer for the next 5 years (sometimes bleeding into Fall and Winters) for the same place. When I was not working there I was working at my mother’s store she managed (retail!). I feel early on I gained a good sense of work ethic. It was needed. 
	After high school I began Plumbing. I went to a real big shot (non-union) Plumbing school and became a plumber’s apprentice. This involved me going to school weekly and some weekends as well as on-the-job training. In the construction world things worked differently than what I was used to. I could be at one company for three months and then come a Friday I was handed two checks and told there was no more work for me. So I had to “sign the books” as they said. Put my name on a waiting list at school for the never available spot. I learned patience and waiting and a whole lot of trusting at that moment. Eventually I found another place which actually liked me a lot. When work slowed, they did what they could to keep me around. 
	I felt bad when I told them that I was moving to Texas (via California) and put in my two-week notice. Why Texas? My wife! So after two years of apprenticeships, I put it on hold. Moved to Texas, got married. I worked at the SPCA in the area as a maintenance worker. Then during that year my wife got pregnant and I got serious and we MOVED BACK to California, so I could finish my apprenticeship. Worked for three different companies in the next 2 years as I finished my apprenticeship. The first two back were short ones and then the last one I stayed out until I finished my apprenticeship and got my license as an official plumber! Stayed for a bit until we decided to move back to Texas.
	After moving back to Texas and trying the plumbing thing out, it unfortunately didn’t work out too well. You see, the plumbing school I went to was one of the largest non-union schools, a great school and growing. But in Texas, unions are everything. So it was not easy finding work. The plan I had didn’t work out and I improvised, got another maintenance job in the area. That was until a position opened up at a Software Company where my brother-in-laws worked.
	Yes, a SOFTWARE COMPANY. What? Why would that interest plumbers apprentice you? Well, it did. Seemed stable, my brother-in-laws assured me it was something I could do. So I went Christmas Eve and interviewed, they hired me on the spot and I began training on the day after Christmas. 
	From there I worked as an Application Support Representative for a year and some change. During that time I immersed myself in the technological world. It was awesome! I had already been around computers in the normal capacity and knew how to type really well (author story is on Portfolio Phase One) so I fit right in. I am a pretty quick learner, if someone shows me the ropes and I can follow along and ask questions and do it then I’m good. I did lots of customer support and worked on digital clocks, different SSH stuff. But then something caught my eye. These reports requests we kept sending to this guy. He did them in SQL and I had only known how to look around the place. So, I begin to dive in. I had my brother-in-law programmer to help me - plus the current SQL guy. I began taking more and more stuff away from him, trying it on my own. Then the request got slower and slower. I asked why and the SQL Guy was becoming a Dev Guy. One Memorial Day weekend it rained and rained and rained in the Houston area. Our building completely flooded.
	That began my first “work from home” experience. It was great but something was wrong. Reports were not getting done fast enough. I did what I thought was right. I started taking the report requests myself instead of passing them off to the SQL Guy (after asking my supervisor if it was okay). For the next few months I was the unofficial SQL Guy. As soon as we were back in the office it became official. SQL Guy was now official Dev Guy and Me Guy, was now SQL Guy!
	And the new journey began because at that time I also began University. Yes, Brian ex-laborer, ex-plumber, went to college. I started my Information Technology degree and didn’t look back. While I worked as the SQL Developer, I also went to school full time. 
Five years passed. I was very comfortable with SQL work now. Confident. I was nearing the end of my school, a bachelor's degree in IT: Web Development! March 2020 hit and I graduated! 3 cheers for me! Hip hip hooray, hip hip hooray, hip hip hooray. My birthday was around the corner too. College graduate, turning 32, let’s go!
“NOT TODAY!” - Covid 19. The sad news indeed. But everything is still alright. Now, let’s back up a bit just a few months.
Review time at work. The question “What are your plans?” they asked. Which was a good question. And I was honest with them and they were very respectful and honest with me. I appreciated that. I said I want to be a web developer. Either at this company or at another company. They also said that they could not pay me what I am worth in my current position AND that there was really no Jr. Developer/Programmer positions that I could fill there. But to keep trying and maybe something will happen. So, that began my non-school related learning of Development and Programming. I started passively applying to new jobs, had an interview right before covid hit. 
Which brings us to current events. The month of September when I began my “Applying-Spree” to jobs. Now, here I am making this website as a sort of giant Cover Letter and Resume / Portfolio.
And my goals?
I need guidance. I need that Junior position. Just like my plumbing apprenticeship when I had Journeyman and Foreman directing me, showing me the ropes, guiding me, correcting me and teaching me. Just like when I had my brother-in-law helping me, teaching me, showing me how to learn myself and giving me constant advice. I need someone now to take me like the clay that I am and mold and shape me into a great developer. Become a programmer who writes clean code, understands the need to always learn, who knows how to approach and conquer problems, and someone able to then teach others. And yeah, that is my story. I am but clay waiting for the potter's hands to shape me into something awesome.
